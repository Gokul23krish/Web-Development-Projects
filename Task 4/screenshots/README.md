# Screenshots Guide

Please replace the placeholder SVGs with real screenshots.

Required files:
- homepage.png — Capture of `index.html`
- post.png — Capture of any one post page, e.g. `post-1.html`

How to capture:
1. Open the page in your browser.
2. Set width to ~1440px for a desktop view (or use a mobile width to show responsiveness).
3. Take a screenshot and save it into this folder with the exact file names above.

You can delete the `*-placeholder.svg` files after adding the PNG screenshots.
